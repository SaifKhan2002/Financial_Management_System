# Financial Management System Using MATLAB

This project implements a **Financial Management System** using **MATLAB**, which performs comprehensive financial analysis over a five-year period. The system incorporates various techniques such as **profitability calculation**, **economic allocation analysis**, **digital signal processing** for data smoothing, and **frequency analysis** to provide deeper insights into financial data trends.

The system provides financial metrics like profit margins, return on assets, debt ratios, and visualizes these metrics with advanced signal processing techniques like the **Butterworth filter** and **Fourier Transform**.

You can run the code in the **latest version of MATLAB** or through **MATLAB Online**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Overview

The **Financial Management System** analyzes financial data, including revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities, over a **five-year period**. Key **financial ratios** like **Net Profit Margin**, **Return on Assets**, and **Debt-Equity Ratio** are calculated and used for decision-making.

The system leverages **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** to smooth and filter the data, ensuring that the results are clean and reliable. Additionally, the **Fourier Transform (FFT)** is applied to analyze the frequency components of the financial data and to detect patterns over time.

### Key Outputs Include:
- **Profitability Analysis**: Measures how effectively a company is generating profit.
- **Economic Allocation**: Measures efficiency in utilizing assets and managing liabilities.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize trends in financial data over time.
- **Frequency Spectrum Analysis**: Understand the frequency components in financial trends.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Financial Analysis**: Includes profitability calculations, economic allocation, and key financial ratios.
- **Low-pass Butterworth Filter**: Smoothens data such as revenue, costs, and profit to remove noise.
- **Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Analyzes the frequency components of financial data to identify recurring trends.
- **Time Series Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of data trends over time.
- **Multi-Year Analysis**: Collects and processes data over a 5-year period, enabling long-term financial insights.
- **Data Plots**: Generates visual outputs such as time series and frequency spectrum plots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: MATLAB
- **Digital Signal Processing**: Butterworth Filter for data smoothing
- **Fourier Analysis**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- **Data Visualization**: MATLAB plotting functions for time series and frequency spectra
